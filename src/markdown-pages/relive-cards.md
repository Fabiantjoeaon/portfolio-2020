### Shareable interactions

<a href="https://relive.cc" target="_blank">Relive</a> creates 3D videos of your outdoor activities.
By adding pictures, statistics and locations, these videos give a lot of context and meanings to your ride, runs and more. The downside of this being that videos
like these can get very long.<br/><br/>
For my first project during my internship at Relive I created Relive Cards, which are a shorter form of videos that highlight the
important statistics of your ride.
