### Shareable interactions

<a href="https://relive.cc" target="_blank">Relive</a> creates 3D videos of your outdoor activities.
By adding pictures, statistics and locations, these videos give a lot of context and meanings to your ride, runs and more. The downside of this being that videos
like these can get very long.<br/><br/>
For my first project during my internship at Relive I worked on Relive Cards, which are a shorter form of videos that highlight the
important statistics of your ride.

### Motion

After lots of iterations with different motions and easings I prototyped a first version along with the in-house designer, where-as the design
of the card mostly changed during development, where choices were made based on technical findings and possible limitations. <br/><br/>

Afterwards we ended up with a better version compared to the initial design shown above, that gave more context to the individual statistics instead of just being random shapes with linear animations.<br/> This design was stress tested with different forms of activities (hikes, runs, rides), data, and colors.
